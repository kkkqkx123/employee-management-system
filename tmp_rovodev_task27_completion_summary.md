   - Token validation and refresh

6. **RoleServiceImplTest** - Role management tests
   - Role creation and assignment
   - Resource assignment to roles
   - Role deletion with usage validation
   - Search and filtering functionality

### 27.2 Integration Tests ✅

Created integration tests for critical service workflows:

1. **DepartmentServiceIntegrationTest** - Database integration tests
   - Full CRUD operations with database persistence
   - Hierarchical department structure testing
   - Search functionality with actual database queries
   - Transaction rollback testing

2. **EmailServiceIntegrationTest** - Email service integration
   - Email sending with database logging
   - Template processing with variable substitution
   - Bulk email processing
   - Async email processing verification
   - Email statistics calculation

3. **SecurityServiceIntegrationTest** - Security integration tests
   - User creation with password encoding
   - Authentication with database verification
   - Failed login tracking and account locking
   - User status management (activate/deactivate)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Unit Test Features
- **@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)** setup for all unit tests
- **@Mock** annotations for repository and dependency mocking
- **@InjectMocks** for service under test injection
- Comprehensive business logic validation
- Exception handling verification
- Async method testing where applicable

### Integration Test Features
- **@SpringBootTest** configuration for full application context
- **@ActiveProfiles("test")** for test-specific configuration
- **@Transactional** for test data isolation
- Real database interactions with H2/PostgreSQL
- Async processing verification with Awaitility
- Email service testing with mock SMTP

### Test Coverage
- All major service implementations now have comprehensive unit tests
- Critical integration workflows are covered
- Exception scenarios and edge cases are tested
- Business logic validation is thoroughly tested
- Security features including authentication and authorization

- `src/test/java/com/example/demo/integration/SecurityServiceIntegrationTest.java`

## Quality Assurance
- All tests follow Spring Boot testing best practices
- Proper use of Mockito for unit testing
- Integration tests use actual Spring context
- Test data isolation with transactions
- Comprehensive assertion coverage
- Exception scenario testing

## Next Steps
Task 27 is now complete. The service layer has comprehensive test coverage including:
- Unit tests for business logic validation
- Integration tests for database interactions
- Security testing for authentication flows
- Email service testing with async processing
- Exception handling and edge case coverage

This provides a solid foundation for Task 28 (Controller and API Testing) and ensures the service layer is thoroughly tested and reliable.
